## ACCESS PROTOCOL: RYUX411

Ryu operates in cycles of design and execution, each construct deliberate, each layer a foundation for what follows.  
The work is not measured in surface metrics or visible graphs but in the systems that persist beneath them — resilient, adaptive, built to endure.  

What emerges is not code alone, but frameworks that bind structure to intent.  
This repository is both ledger and signal, tracing the path of a developer driven by precision, scale, and vision.

## PRIMARY PROTOCOLS

These are the trusted frameworks where Ryu’s expertise is deepest.  
Battle-tested technologies, consistently deployed to deliver resilient systems and scale-ready architectures:

## EXTENDED SYSTEMS

The operational range expands beyond the primary core — architectures tested, explored, and integrated where the mission demanded.  
These are not the centre of gravity like Next.js, but extensions of range, proof of adaptability, and readiness to engage across the stack.
