# Ryu — Software Engineer & Systems Architect

I design and build scalable, resilient software systems across application, infrastructure, and security layers.  
My work spans frontend and backend engineering, distributed services, automation, systems programming, and cybersecurity.

I focus on architecture that remains stable under pressure, performs efficiently at scale, and can be maintained long-term.  
Most commercial work remains private due to enterprise involvement and internal development contracts. This repository serves as a technical overview of the stacks, tools, and engineering domains I operate in.

## Approach

I build systems with an emphasis on structure, reliability, and long-term operational stability.  
Technology decisions are driven by performance, maintainability, and architectural clarity rather than trends.

The goal is consistent execution: software that scales, adapts, and endures.
