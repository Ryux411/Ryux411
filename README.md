# Ryu — Software Engineer & Systems Architect

I design and build software as systems, not features.

My work focuses on architecture, reliability, performance, and security across the full lifecycle of applications — from low-level implementation to infrastructure and operational stability. I operate across frontend, backend, systems engineering, and security-aware development, with an emphasis on building software that endures under real-world pressure.

Most commercial work remains private due to enterprise involvement and internal contracts. This space serves as a technical profile and a reflection of the engineering domains I work within.

## Engineering Focus

- Large-scale application architecture  
- Security-aware system design  
- Backend services & distributed systems  
- Real-time data flow & event-driven systems  
- Performance-critical frontend engineering  
- Infrastructure & deployment pipelines  
- Automation and operational tooling  
- Long-term maintainability and system evolution  

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Architecture before implementation  
- Design for failure, not ideal conditions  
- Stability and clarity over trend adoption  
- Performance and security as first-class concerns  
- Systems built to scale, adapt, and persist  

I prioritize structure, correctness, and resilience.  
Technology choices are driven by practical value, longevity, and operational reliability.

## Approach

I work best in environments where systems must be stable, secure, and scalable over time.

The focus is not experimentation for its own sake, but execution — building software that performs reliably, evolves cleanly, and holds under production conditions.
