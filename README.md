# Ryu — Software Engineer, Systems Architect, and Epistemology-Driven Builder

My name is Ryu. I was named after a Tibetan monk my father met while climbing mountains — a reminder that discipline, clarity, and perspective matter as much as strength. That story informs how I approach engineering: with curiosity, rigor, and a commitment to understanding *how* things work, not just *that* they work.

I treat software development as an epistemological exercise — the study of how we know what we know. Every system is a chain of assumptions, constraints, and evidence. My work focuses on building architectures that are observable, testable, and resilient, where decisions are grounded in reasoning rather than trend or habit.

I design and build software as systems, not features.

My work centers on architecture, reliability, performance, and security across the full lifecycle of applications — from low-level implementation to infrastructure and operational stability. I operate across frontend, backend, systems engineering, and security-aware development, with an emphasis on building software that endures under real-world pressure.

Most commercial work remains private due to enterprise involvement and internal contracts. This space serves as a technical profile and a reflection of the engineering domains I work within.

## Engineering Focus

* Large-scale application architecture
* Security-aware system design
* Backend services & distributed systems
* Real-time data flow & event-driven systems
* Performance-critical frontend engineering
* Infrastructure & deployment pipelines
* Automation and operational tooling
* Long-term maintainability and system evolution

---

## Engineering Philosophy

* Architecture before implementation
* Design for failure, not ideal conditions
* Stability and clarity over trend adoption
* Performance and security as first-class concerns
* Systems built to scale, adapt, and persist
* Decisions grounded in evidence, testing, and reasoning

I prioritize structure, correctness, and resilience.
Technology choices are driven by practical value, longevity, and operational reliability.

## Approach

I work best in environments where systems must be stable, secure, and scalable over time.

The focus is execution grounded in reasoning — building software that is observable, verifiable, and resilient. Systems should perform reliably, evolve cleanly, and withstand real production conditions.
